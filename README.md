# World Data Scrqper 
## Summary
I created a scraper to collect population and other related data from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/
) 
I wanted to work with and visualize a data set that I parsed myself. The simplest way to use my spider would be to put
in the spiders folder in a Scrapy project.
