# Historical Data Scraping

## Summary
    For this project I wanted to obtain a data set for visulization through webscraping. Using the scrapy module for Python I scraped [Worldometer's Country page](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) for the necessary information.
## Anaconda Navigator
    I use Anaconda Navigator to keep all of my virtual environments in one place.
### Installation
    To to download the installer for Anaconda navigator go [here for MacOS](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#macos). For other operating systems here is the [installation page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). 
### Creating an Environment 
    Once Anaconda Navigator is installed you will want to set up a virtual environment. When you open Anaconda there will be a menu on the side. Click on th Environments tab. [Click the Environments tab](image link).
